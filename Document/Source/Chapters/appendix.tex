\section{Corner thresholding}
\label{sec:corner_thresholding}
describe the corner thresholding approach here.

\section{Depth Field Variances}
describe how depth field variances can be computed and how they can be used. Additionally, describe the run-mode in the pipeline and maybe also offer some results and limitations.
