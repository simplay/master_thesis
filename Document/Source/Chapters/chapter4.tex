In this chapter we explain in detail the relevant stages of our motion segmentation pipeline. We start by formulate the initial problem statement our pipeline tries to solve. Moreover, for each stage, we describe its required input data and what output it generates. Lastly, we also mention all assumptions and induced limitations for each pipeline stage. \\ \\
The problem statement our pipeline solves is defined as follows: 
Given a set of images that form a video sequence and their associated depth maps. Our goal is to separate the images into regions that form coherent and independent rigidly moving objects. \\ \\
%SHOW FIGURE OF PROBLEM STATEMENT
% INPUT: IMGS, DEPTHS, OUTPUT: SEGMENTATION
% SHOW LATER A DETAILED PIPELINE
The idea of such a segmentation is to identify and extract the meaningful rigid motions from the background. To accomplish this task we compute the optical flow on the images and use it as a guide for grouping pixel regions that belong together. Since the object motion in coherent image sequence is not independent for every frame, the optical flow depicts an ideal cue for making grouping decisions. \\ \\
Our pipeline has the following main stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Dataset Preparations}: Initially, the frames of a video have to be extracted and named according to the pipeline naming conventions. If present, also the depth maps have to be named and re-normalized according to the pipeline's conventions. Optionally, a blurred version of the input images are computed by using a bilateral filter. This filtered images act as an additional, but optional cue, for a later pipeline stage. 
\item \textbf{Optical Flows}: We compute the forward- and backward-flows on our input sequence using different existing implementations. Our pipeline lets the user select a target method for generating the optical flow fields.
\item \textbf{Data Extraction}: In this stage we extract traceable feature locations in our images. Also, a mask containing all invalid tracking locations per image is computed by checking whether the the forward and backward flow correspond to each other. Optionally, depth data, flow and depth variances and color maps are extracted that are used within a later pipeline stage. 
\item \textbf{Trajectories}: We use the computed forward flows and the previously extracted traceable feature locations to perform a point tracking. A sequence of traced points form a so called trajectory. In every frame a trajectory can either be started, ended or be continued. The previously computed traceable locations act as the starting points, the forward flow is added to a traceable location and yield the tracked to position, the starting location in the next frame. Tracked to locations that land in an invalid mask location cause the tracking of a trajectory. 
\item \textbf{Affinity Matrix}: In this stage we compute the similarities between all trajectory pairs. The similarity is computed according to different metrics, which are basically a combination of various distances among overlapping trajectory parts. 
\item \textbf{Sparse Motion Segmentation}: Using the affinity matrix plus the nearest neighbouring trajectories per trajectory, we can compute its dense segmentation by either applying a spectral clustering on the affinity matrix or by reformulating the problem as a graph cut problem. Usually 
\item \textbf{Dense Segmentation}: Our pipeline allows to transform the sparse segmentation into a dense segmentation. For this purpose we consider the hole filling problem, formulating it as a convex problem and then solving it using a primal-dual approach using the sparse segmentation as the initial input.
\item \textbf{Evaluation}: Our pipeline allows to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the generated sparse and dense segmentations. In addition, we also can explore various parameter settings and their outcomes using different visualizers.
\end{enumerate}
In the following sections we examine and discuss each individual pipeline stage in detail. 

\section{Dataset Preparations}
The preparation of an input datasets is the very first stage of our pipeline. Initially, we have to either capture a video using one of our capturing devices or use an existing video sequence. Next, we extract all the frames from the considered video. \\ \\
In case there are also depth maps$\footnote{In case we are working with depth data, we assume that there exists one depth map per frame. Our pipeline assumes, that the values in the depth images are in meter units}$ available, they are transformed such that the value range is in meter units. For further information about the dataset conventions, read section~\ref{sec:datasets} on page~\pageref{sec:datasets}. \\ \\
Optionally, a filtered version of the input dataset images can be generated using a Bilateral Filter$\footnote{A Bilateral Filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving blur filter.}$. These filtered images can help improve the process of finding traceable candidate location as well as identifying invalid tracking locations.

\section{Computing Optical Flows}
\label{sec:impl_optical_flow}
In this section we give a brief introduction to the flow methods that can be utilized in our pipeline. Flow fields are used to perform the point tracking to extract motion trajectories, to detect occlusions and for computing the affinities between trajectories. Therefore, the quality of the flow fields highly affects the quality of the motion segmentation. \\ \\
A conceptual idea as well as a mathematical formulation is provided in section $\ref{sec:optical_flow}$ on page $\pageref{sec:optical_flow}$. \\ \\
Our pipeline strictly relies on existing implementations of the following four flow methods: Large displacement optical flow (LDOF), the original flow method proposed by Horn and Schunck (HS), Semi-rigid scene flow (SRSF) and Layered RGBD flow (LRGB). An example output generated by these method when running the same frame sequence is shown in figure $\ref{fig:flow_method_flows}$.

\label{fig:flow_method_flows}
\end{figure}
In the reminder of this section we summarize the used flow methods.

\subsection{HS}
In $\cite{Deq10}$ Dequing Sun et al studied various flow methods and models and determined the most important factors that increase the quality of produced flows. They incorporated their findings in Horn and Schunck's original formulation and contributed a efficient implementation of their method. Additional information about their formulations can be found in section $\ref{sec:hs_formulation}$ on page $\pageref{sec:hs_formulation}$. \\ \\
When using the abbreviation HS we strictly refer to their implementation. \\ \\
The original HS formulation combines a data term that assumes constancy of some image property with a spatial term that models how the flow is expected to vary across the image. The HS model relies on brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions. Unfortunately it is not very robust to outliers. Therefore, the following main improvements were implemented in their methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The quadratic penalty function is replaced by the Charbonnier penalty $p\left( x \right) = \sqrt{x^2 + \epsilon^2}$. This penalty is supposed to be more error-prone to outliers.
  \item An incremental multi-resolution technique is applied to estimate flow fields with large displacements. The optical flow estimated at a coarse level is used to warp the second image toward the first at the next finer level and a flow increment is calculated between the first image and the warped second image. Each level is recursively downsampled by applying a Gaussian filter from its nearest lower level.
  \item An enhanced objective function is used, which including a non-local term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. This is achieved by applying a median filtering to denoise the flow after every warping step to increase the accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LDOF}
Before the work in $\cite{Bro11a}$, there was no accurate method present to estimate fast motions of small objects, i.e. large motions. Most flow methods are based on a combination of HS flow formulation and the concept of coarse-to-fine image warping. However, both approaches have been extended by robust statistics to fight outliers and the same time retain smoothness assumptions. \\ \\
Two fundamental ideas exist to address the issue of large motions. On on hand there are coarse-to-fine techniques. Such techniques, however, require a downsampling. Unfortunately, this also removes details that may be important for the flow accuracy. consequently, the method cannot refine the flow of structures that are smaller than their displacement, because the structure is smoothed away. Flows produced this way are often close to the motion of the larger scale structures. \\ \\
On the other hand descriptor matching techniques are well suited to match large displacements. However, their resulting correspondences are very sparse, have limited accuracy and exhibit many outliers to to missing regularity constraints and lastly, there is only pixel-level accuracy. \\ \\
In their paper they propose a method how to combine both strategies. They direct a variational technique using correspondences from sparse descriptor matching. The correspondences determined by the descriptors are directly integrated into the variational approach. The allows to make use of all image information at every level and smoothly scales down the influence of descriptor keypoints as the grid gets finer.

\subsection{SRSF}

scene flow that exploits the local and piecewise rigidity of real world scene. 

use RGBD images as input for estimating the scene flow

compute the optical flow from RGB images and infer the scene flow from the depth data.

in their work: the scene structure can be represented in the image domain, where color and depth data can be coupled using a projective function. this way depth influences the motion in the image domain and consistency constraints can be formulated jointly over the color and depth images.

scene flow estimation using intensity and depth is an ill-posed problem and regularization is needed.

usually, the 3d motion vector if each point is solved to minimize color and intensity constraints in a data term and the whole 3d motion field is regularized to get spatially smooth solutions while preserving discontinuities. since depth data is available a weighted regularization can be used to preserve motion discontinuities along depth edges. 

in this work use the fact that most real scenes can be well modeled as locally or piecewise rigid, i.e. the scene is composed of 3d independently rigid components. 

contribution: an over-parameterized framework for estimating scene flows from RGBD images. The scene flow is modeled as a vector field of rigid body motions. 

a method to compute dense scene flow from RGBD images by modeling the motion as a field of rigid motions. This allows for piecewise smooth solutions using a TV regularization on the paramterization. 

The proposed apporach provides an adjustable combination between local and piecewise rigidity, hich in conjunction with a global rigid estimation is able to capture the motion in real world scenes.

%s1 
propose    a    per-pixel    over-
parameterized representation using rotation and translation
to  capture  the  global  rigid  motion  of  the  scene  while
allowing  local  deviations.    Their  method  is  more  suited
for  a  single  moving  object.   By  comparison  our  method
captures the global 3D motion for each individually moving
object  and  can  handle  multiple  moving  objects

%s2
overparametrize scene flow and estimate a 6-DoF rigid- body motion at each pixel. They regularize the flow field in this 6-DoF parametrization such that their model favors lo- cally rigid motions

\subsection{LRGBD}
In $\cite{Deq10}$ Dequing Sun et al present a layered RGBD scene flow estimation  method. They make use of the fact that depth information allows to recover 3d motion from a single view. However, in that case, depth boundaries are not well aligned with RGB images. Especially in occluded regions methods produce large errors. As a remedy, they therefore, use the depth fields for occlusion reasoning and formulate a layered RGBD scene flow method that jointly solves for the scene segmentation and the motion. In their formulation, the depth fields are used to estimate the per-layer 3d rigid motion to constraint the motion of each layer. \\ \\
The implementation of their method is freely available on the authors website, written in Matlab. In the following we use the abbreviation LRGBD for flows produced by their implementation.
%s1
%estimate general 2D motion by decomposition into several layers, which enables occlusion reasoning

%s2
%Other methods do segment the scene to impose rigidity or strong regularization over the regions (or segments). However, these segmentations are only used as tools to improve the accuracy of the estimates, and do not really cor-
%respond to the underlying/independent motions of the scene => partitions the scene into depth layers
%Therefore, the segmentation-from-motion problem, which can be particularly useful for scene understanding or human-machine interaction, is not truely addressed by these methods.

\subsection{Tracking Candidates}
In this section we explain our approach how we determine image locations that exhibit meaningful motion information and thus are good candidates to track. The found tracking candidates are later used as the staring position by our point tracker and thus responsible for detecting moving objects. \\ \\
The simplest idea would be to track every pixel location. On one hand, this would indeed capture every moving object. On the other hand, however, this also would make the motion tracking task highly inefficient, yet infeasible for common image resolutions. Therefore, we want a method which offers us a sparse sampling of the image locations but the same time hits enough meaningful candidates. \\ \\
Ideally, we want to use a feature detector that ignores points in homogeneous areas but selects points that show structural information in their vicinity. Since image corners exhibit a lot of structural information a Harris detector is a solid choice to approach this task. \\ \\
The idea of this detector is the following: A corner defines an intersection of two edges. Therefore, it represents a point in which the directions of these two edges change. For images this means that the gradient has a large variance at that location. \\
It is possible to describe the average intensity change in any direction $(x,y)$
as a bilinear from
\begin{equation}
\left( x,y \right) M \colvec{x}{y}	
\end{equation}.
In the Harris detector, every image location is then described in terms of the eigenvalues of $M$. Moreover, the detector uses the pixel-wise eigenvectors to measure the corner response. Good corners have a large intensity change in all directions thus their measured response should be large and positive. A detailed formulation can given in section $\ref{sec:harris_corner_detector}$ on page $\pageref{sec:harris_corner_detector}$. \\ \\
% State idea behind the harris detector: briefly, add math. def to background




Figure $\ref{fig:tracable_candidates}$ illustrates the feature locations that can be used in the tracking stage of the pipeline. For a given image as shown in subfigure $\ref{fig:c14_f1_cand}$ we initially compute interseting features using by applying a Harris corner detector onto it. The result is shown in figure $\ref{fig:c14_cand_corners}$. We filter weak corner candidates by thresholding too weak corners. A detailed explanation how this thresholding works is described in the appending in section $\ref{sec:corner_thresholding}$ on page $\pageref{sec:corner_thresholding}$.

 The remaining corners form a boolean selection mask as shown in figure $\ref{fig:c14_cand_dense}$. Finally, to avoid oversampling, we further reduce the number of samplings by only taking every $n-th$ sample location. The final tracking candidates are shown in figure $\ref{fig:c14_cand_sparse}$, illustrated as red dots, overlaid on top of the initial input image.

\label{fig:tracable_candidates}
\end{figure}






% therefore, only reliable points are kept and we remove points that doe not show any structure in their vicinity based on the smaller eigenvalue of the structure tensor. 

For efficiency reasons, we spatially subsample the initial points.
factors larger than 12 lose details as there are not enough points to cover small object parts. on the other hand, factors smaller than 6 waste computation time as smaller objects tend to get smoothed away. 

An illustration of different sampling rates is shown in figure $\ref{fig:sampling_rate_candidates}$.

\end{figure}


Traceable candidate locations are obtained by applying a Harris Corner Detector on the input image. 
Features that are identified as corners are a viable option for starting a trajectory tracking.

in addition, a boolean grid with a certain cell size is applied to the candidates, acting as a selection mask. This reduces the number of tracking candidates (spacial subsampling) drastically and makes the sampling sparser.


mention how invalid regions are computed: occluded regions.

\caption[Strict Dense Candidates]{A visualization of the final dense traceable features.}
\label{fig:tracable_candidates_strict}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Occlusion detection}
idea: stop tracking points as soon as a point gets occluded.

in tracking, occlusion is usually detected by comparing the appearance of the local neighborhood of the tracked point over time. in contrast, we detect occlusions by verifying the consistency of the forward and the backward flow.

Occlusion is detected by applying the backward flow to a continued tracked point and checking whether that resulting point has the same origin as the actual tracked from position. Figure $\ref{fig:occlusion_detection}$ illustrates this concept of occlusion detection.
%TODO create figure showing: point in frame 1 gets  tolerance interval
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth] {implementation/occlusion/occ_det}
\end{center}
\caption[Occlusion Detection]{Conceptual illustration of occlusion detection. For any tracking candidate we apply its corresponding forward flow to find its position in the next frame. From there, we look-up its backward flow and apply it on the tracked to position. If we land close to the point in the original tracked from frame, we say, that the point is not occluded and otherwise we call the point occluded.}
\label{fig:occlusion_detection}
\end{figure}
In non-occluded case, the backward flow vector points in the inverse direction of the forward flow vector. if this consistency required is not satisfied, the point is either getting occluded at frame $t+1$ (the next frame) or the flow was not correctly estimated. both are good reasons to stop tracking this point at frame $t$. Since there are always some small estimation errors in the optical flow, there is a small tolerance interval granted. The formula used to decide when a point is not occluded is given in equation $\ref{eq:occlussion_error_tol}$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \forall p_t \in \text{Frame t}:	\norm{\hat{p_t}-p_t}_2^2 < \epsilon \norm{\hat{w}_t - w_t}_2^2 + b \\
& \text{where } \hat{p_t} = p_{t+1} + \hat{w_t} \text{ with } p_{t+1} = p_t + w_t
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:occlussion_error_tol}
\end{equation} \\
Occlusion comes with the opposite phenomenon disocclision or scaling. to fill these areas not covered by trajectory yet, new trajectories are initialized, in empty areas in each new frame using the same strategy as for the first frame.

\end{figure}

the color values are stored as CIE lab color images.

\subsection{Flow Variance}

In a later stage in our pipeline, we will compute differences between different optical flow field locations. Since our optical flows may contain noise, especially along motion boundaries, we have to make our pipeline robust to these negative influence of noise. In particular, when taking the difference between two noisy flow locations, the noise level can get amplified. The purpose of this section is to describe a method how to normalize flow differences. 

An simple, but initial first idea would be to smooth the computed flow fields, to reduce the noise level along the boundaries. A commonly used approach to blur an image is to convolve the image with a Gaussian kernel as defined in equation $\ref{eq:gaussian_filter}$.
\begin{equation}
	G_{\sigma}\left( x \right) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2}}
\label{eq:gaussian_filter}
\end{equation}
However, filtering the flows directly is not the best choice. The reason for this is based on the fact that a Gaussian filter acts as a low-pass filter. Thus, after applying this kernel, many details in the flow, such as motion boundaries, will be washed out or will be removed completely. \\ \\
Another blur filter, which addresses the issue of smoothing out edges, is the so called Bilateral Filter $\textbf{BF}$. Similar to the Gaussian Convolution, this filter also computes a weighed average of an image, but the same time takes into account the variation of intensities to preserve edges. 

Let $\bf{I}$ denote an image and $\bf{p}$ one of its pixels. The neighborhood pixels of $\bf{p}$ are denoted by $\mathcal{N}_p$. Then, the Bilateral filter $\textbf{BF}$ can be defined as described in equation $\ref{eq:bilateral_filter}$.
\begin{equation}
	\textbf{BF} \left\{ \bf{I}_{\bf{p}} \right\} = \frac{1}{W_{\bf{p}}} \sum_{\bf{q} \in \mathcal{N}_p} w_{\bf{p}, \bf{q}} \left( \bf{I} \right) \bf{I}_{\bf{q}}
\label{eq:bilateral_filter}
\end{equation}
Note that $w_{\bf{p}, \bf{q}}$ denotes the weight between the pixels $\bf{p}$ and $\bf{q}$, whereas the term $W_{\bf{p}}$ defined in equation $\ref{eq:bilateral_filter_weights}$ is the sum of all weights between a fixed pixel $\bf{p}$ and its neighbors.

\begin{equation}
	w_{\bf{p}, \bf{q}} \left( \bf{I} \right) = G_{\sigma_s} (\norm{\bf{p} - \bf{q}}) G_{\sigma_r} (\bf{I}_{\bf{p}} - \bf{I}_{\bf{q}}) 
\label{eq:bilateral_filter_neighbor_weight}
\end{equation}

The weight in equation $\ref{eq:bilateral_filter_neighbor_weight}$ has a spatial component $G_{\sigma_s} (\norm{\bf{p} - \bf{q}})$ as well as it considers the intensity range $G_{\sigma_r} (\bf{I}_{\bf{p}} - \bf{I}_{\bf{q}})$.

\begin{equation}
	W_{\bf{p}} \left( \bf{I} \right) = \sum_{\bf{q} \in \mathcal{N}_p} w_{\bf{p}, \bf{q}} \left( \bf{I} \right)
\label{eq:bilateral_filter_weights}
\end{equation}
Instead of using a filtered flow field, we go for another, more robust idea. Imagine we would know the error of the computed flows. Then, by using the variance of the field, we directly could address the error by normalizing the flow value by its corresponding variance value. Since we do not know the actual error, we have to define a good estimator of the flow variance. \\ \\
Let $\bf{q}_p$ denote a vector containing all neighbors of pixel $\bf{p}$ and $\bf{w}_p$ is the vector consisting of all weights computed using equation $\ref{eq:bilateral_filter_neighbor_weight}$. Mathematically, this can be formulated as the follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \bf{q_p} = \left( q_1, \dots, q_{|\mathcal{N}_p|} \right) \\
& \bf{w_p} = \left( w_{p, q_1}, \dots, w_{p, q_{|\mathcal{N}_p|}} \right) \\
& \text{where } \forall q_k \in \mathcal{N}_p
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:bilat_weight_components}
\end{equation}

The definitions from equation $\ref{eq:bilat_weight_components}$ allow us to define an expected value of pixel $\bf{p}$.

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E} \left[ \bf{p} \right] = \frac{\bf{w}_{p}^{T} \bf{q}_p}{\norm{\bf{w}_{p}}}
\end{equation}

For a given optical flow $\bf{F} = (\bf{F_u}, \bf{F_v})$ we can compute its variance by the definition stated in equation $\ref{eq:flow_var_opt_flow}$.
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{Var} \left[ \bf{F} \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbf{Var} \left[ \bf{F_u} \right] + \mathbf{Var} \left[ \bf{F_v} \right] \right)
\label{eq:flow_var_opt_flow}	
\end{equation}

flow estimation can be noisy for various reasons and the problem is that the nois is often proportional to the magnitude of the absolud flow. thus using a simple flow difference as ameasure will constantly underestimate the simmilarity between heigh magnitude flow. 

Lets assume 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\colvec{u_1}{v_1} = f + \colvec{x_1}{y_1} \\
\colvec{u_2}{v_2} = f + \colvec{x_2}{y_2}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:def_flow_tracking}	
\end{equation}

where f is the true flow and 
\begin{equation}
	\colvec{x_1}{y_1} \sim \colvec{x_2}{y_2}
\end{equation}

Let us assume, that the random variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ are i.i.d. distributed having a zero mean and a variance $\sigma_x^2$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, i.e.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x_1 \sim x_2 (0, \sigma_x^2) \\
y_1 \sim y_2 (0, \sigma_y^2
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:def_flow_tracking}	
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{E} \left[ \norm{\colvec{u_1}{v_1} - \colvec{u_2}{v_2}} \right]
& = \mathbf{E} \left[ (u_1 - u_2)^2 \right] + \mathbf{E} \left[ (v_1 - v_2)^2 \right] \\
& = \mathbf{E} \left[ u_1^2 - 2 u_1 u_2 + u_2^2 \right] + \mathbf{E} \left[ v_1^2 - 2 v_1 v_2 + v_2^2 \right] \\
& = \mathbf{E} \left[ x_1^2 \right] + \mathbf{E} \left[ x_2^2 \right] + \mathbf{E} \left[ y_1^2 \right] + \mathbf{E} \left[ y_2^2 \right] \\
& = 2 \left( \sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 \right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:flow_variance_formula}	
\end{equation}
In the last step of equation $\ref{eq:flow_variance_formula}$ we used the abbreviation $\sigma_x^2$ which denotes the variance of the optical flow along its $x$ direction. In this derivation we exploited the fact that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are independent random variables, $y_1$ and $y_2$ respectively. Hence, the term $\mathbf{E} \left[ x_1 x_2\right]$ yields the value zero.

\section{Trajectories}
As discussed earlier, motion is a spatially and temporal coherent visual cue. This key insight tells us that motion is not frame-wise independent. Hence, we have to extract the whole motion history of every frame location and feed it to a particular segmentation method in order to produce viable motion groupings. To build the history of a point we track it to its successor frames using the optical flow. Such a ordered list of tracked to points is called trajectory. Finally, the set of all possible trajectories forms the seeked motion history. In this section we explain in detail the required steps to generate such trajectories and their 3d version using camera calibration data.

\subsection{Point tracking}
Every point in frame $t$ can be tracked to the next frame $t+1$ by using the optical flow field $w_t$ that belongs to frame $t$. 	In principle, any optical flow method can be used. Our implementation supports various flow methods$\footnote{In general, our pipeline supports any flow method that can produce .flo files. However, the follwoing methods are directly supported: the \textit{ldof}, \textit{hs}, \textit{srsf} and \textit{lrgbd} flow methods}$. Please refer to section $\ref{sec:impl_optical_flow}$ on page $\pageref{sec:impl_optical_flow}$ to get a detailed list and description. Algorithm $\ref{alg:point_tracking}$ \\ \\

\end{algorithm}
$\newline$
Initially, we load all the extracted Harris corner feature locations that belong to the first dataset frame and its corresponding forward flow field. For each such feature location, we lookup its value in the flow field. Next, we add this looked-up flow vector to currently considered feature image coordinate. The result is the \textit{tracked to} position within the second frame. If this computed tracked to position is not occluded, we keep it. Otherwise we discard it. Deciding whether or not a location is occluded is done by performing a lookup in the occlusion mask. Moreover, points that land outside valid image locations are discarded. \\ \\
After processing the first frame, we continue with tracking points in the next frame. This time we not only have to track the extracted Harris features, but we also have to continue every \textit{tracked to} position from the previous iteration. To fill disoccluded areas not covered by trajectory yet, new trajectories are initialized, in empty areas in each new frame using the same strategy as for the first frame. \\ \\
The set of all these locations is processed the same way as described as the points in the initial stage. We repeat this procedure until we visited every dataset frame. \\ \\
Again, please note that tracking data has to be stopped as soon as a point gets occluded. otherwise, the point trajectory will share the motion of two different objects. \\ \\
Finally, figure $\ref{fig:cars_trajectories}$ gives an impression of an actual point tracking, showing the resulting trajectories on the \textit{cars} dataset. As we can see, points tracked in the same moving objects exhibit coherent trajectories.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Transformation to 3d points}
\label{subsection:transform_to_3d_points}
Ultimately, our pipeline should be able to work with 3d data. To enable this, we have to make use of the extracted depth map and use their information in order to transform the 2d trajectory points to 3d points in space. Ideally, the distances, computed to define an affinity measure between trajectories, should be more accurate. 

Given the principal point $p = \left(p_x, p_y \right)$ and the focal lengths $\left(f_x, f_y \right)$ we can compute the following homogeneous transformation:
\begin{equation}
\colvec[f_x X + Z p_x]{f_y Y + Z p_y}{Z} =
\begin{bmatrix}
f_x & 0 & p_x & 0 \\
0 & f_y & p_y & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In the following, let us assume $d \equiv z$. Then

\begin{equation}
	\colvec[X]{X}{Z} \mapsto \left( \frac{f_x x}{d} + p_x, \frac{f_y y}{d} + p_y \right)^T
\end{equation}

since

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	d \left( \frac{x - p_x}{f_x} \right) = \hat{x} \Leftrightarrow \frac{\hat{x}}{d} f_x + p_x = x \\
	d \left( \frac{y - p_y}{f_y} \right) = \hat{y} \Leftrightarrow \frac{\hat{y} f_y}{d} + p_y = y 
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:depth_tranfomation}
\end{equation}.

For given pixel coorinates $\left( x,y \right)$ that indicate image locations, we want to transform them into camera coordinates, using depth maps, by applying equation $\ref{eq:depth_tranfomation}$.

given the extrinsic and intrinsic camera calibration data,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\text{Camera}^{depth} : \left( p^d = (p_x^d, p_y^d), f^d = (f_x^d, f_y^d)\right) \\
	\text{Camera}^{color} : \left( p^c = (p_x^c, p_y^c), f^c = (f_x^c, f_y^c)\right) \\
	\textbf{E} : \text{Camera}^{depth} \rightarrow \text{Camera}^{color}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:calib_data}
\end{equation}.

Steps to transform 2d image locations $\left( u, v \right)$ to 3d positions $\left( x, y, z \right)$ using the camera calibration data defined as in equation $\ref{eq:calib_data}$. Furthermore, let the depth value d $\in$ $\bf{D}$. Then we have to perform the following transformations steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform image location onto depth camera space
\begin{equation}
	\forall (u, v), \forall d = \textbf{D}(u,v): \colvec[\frac{u - p_x^d}{f_x^d} d]{\frac{v - p_y^d}{f_y^d} d}{d} = \colvec[x]{y}{z} \equiv \bf{p}
\end{equation}
\item Align depth camera on color camera by appling the extrinsic matrix $E$:
\begin{equation}
	\forall p: \hat{p} \equiv \colvec[\hat{x}]{\hat{y}}{\hat{z}} =  E p
\end{equation}
\item transform onto color camera
\begin{equation}
	\forall \hat{p} : \left( \hat{u}, \hat{v}\right) = \colvec{\frac{\hat{x}}{\hat{z}} f_x^c + p_x^c}{\frac{\hat{y}}{\hat{z}} f_y^c + p_y^c}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}



\section{Affinity Matrix}
In this section we describe how we compute the so called affinity matrix, which is later used to compute the actual motion segmentation. \\ \\
Generally, trajectories of longer videos are asynchronous, i.e. they cover different temporal windows in a shot. Furthermore, the number of points that are tracked across the whole image sequence is small or even empty due to occlusion, disocclusion or the sampling rate. Hence, a measurement matrix that utilizes the coordinates of the tracked points, as used by the multi-body factorization and subspace methods, will have many missing entries and thus is a bad choice. \\ \\
However, there is a remedy to this issue. We instead compute pairwise affinities between trajectories, because this only requires some trajectories to have some temporal overlap. We define affinities between all pairs of trajectories that share at least a common frame. In the following we denote the tracking points in these shared frames as overlapping parts. \\ \\
Hence, as the very first step our pipeline fetches the previously extracted trajectories to form every possible pair combination. For each trajectory pair different distance values are computed and combined according to an initially by a pre-specified run-mode. More precisely, our pipeline computes the following three distances between overlapping trajectory segments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spatial distance $d_{\text{spatial}}$: Trajectories that belong to the same object are usually spatially close to each other.
  \item The color distance $d_{\text{color}}$: Within a certain object region, associated trajectories are tracked at locations that have a similar color value.
  \item The motion distance $d_{\text{motion}}$: according to the gestalt principle, for each pair of trajectories at the time instant where the motion is maximally different, we can conclude, that the two points do not belong to the same object.
\end{itemize}



The spatial distance is simply the average distance between the overlapping pair segments according to the euclidean norm as defined in equation $\ref{eq:spatial_distance}$.\\ \\
For computing the color distance we use the definition of equation $\ref{eq:color_dist}$. For every overlapping tracking point of any pair, we lookup the color value in its corresponding frame. Then, we compute the distance between the looked-up color values by transforming the color values to the $\text{CIE l*a*b}$ colorspace$\footnote{This transformation enables us to use the l2 norm in order to compute color distances.}$ and then applying the l2 norm. We finally compute the average of these color distances which is equals $d_{\text{color}}$. \\ \\
Lastly, some details about how to compute the motion distance which is formulated in equation $\ref{eq:motion_distance}$. For both trajectories of any pair, we iterate over their overlapping tracking points. The coordinates of those points are used as lookup indices in the corresponding forward flow fields. The idea is to compute the forward difference for every lookup point with a certain step size similar as shown in figure $\ref{fig:motion_dist}$. These forward differences (blue and green arrow) are then assigned to every tracking point. Next, we compute the euclidean norm between the overlapping forward differences. The final motion distance is the average of all these forward difference norms.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth] {implementation/affinities/motion_dist}
   \label{fig:cars_w}
\end{center}
\caption[Motion Distance]{Illustration how the computed forward differences look like indicated by the blue and green vectors. These differences are then used for computing the motion distance $d_{\text{motion}}$.}
\label{fig:motion_dist}
\end{figure}
There are two main setting a user has to specify preliminarily: Whether or not depth cues should be used and which kind of similarity measure should be used. Both options have a large impact on the final outcome of the affinity matrix. \\ \\
When enabling depth cues, all available depth fields are loaded into the pipeline. In combination with the depth- and color-camera calibration data, this enables the pipeline to compute the three dimensional version of each traced trajectory point, analogous as described in the previous subsection $\ref{subsection:transform_to_3d_points}$ on page $\pageref{subsection:transform_to_3d_points}$. This 3d positions are then used for computing the spatial distance between the overlapping parts of any trajectory pair. \\ \\
Our pipeline basically supports two distance combination methods: Either it combines them by calculating the weighted sum of the distance values or it multiplies all the distances. Depending on the used combination strategy, different segmentation methods will later be used. Summed distances can only be used in combination together with the Kernighan-Lin segmentation method whereas the product of distances can be either used in our spectral clustering- or min-cut segmentation method$\footnote{The reason for this limitation is due to the fact that the summed distance method may yield negative affinities since some weights are negative.}$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth] {implementation/affinities/modes}
   \label{fig:cars_w}
\end{center}
\caption[Affinity Pipeline Modes]{An visualization of all affinity compuation modes that can be run by our pipeline. Abbreviations PD and PED stand for product of distances, whereas the additional \it{E} in PED stands for euclidean and hints that we are using Euclidian, metric units instead pixel units. Similarly, SD and SED stand for summed (euclidean) distances. Please note that affinity matrices generated by the mode SD or SED can only be used in combination with the Kernighan-Lin segmentation method but affinities generated by running the modes PD and PED can be used together with spectral clustering and min-cut.}
\label{fig:affinity_modes}
\end{figure}
As shown in figure $\ref{fig:affinity_modes}$, our pipeline offers four different affinity generating modes: PD, SD, PED and SED. When running the mode PD or PED we combine distance by multiplying them. The affinity matrix is computed according to the definition of equation $\ref{eq:prod_dist_affinity}$, the negative weighted exponential of the combined distance value. However, when running the mode SD or SED the distances are summed and the corresponding affinity is computed as defined in equation $\ref{eq:sum_dist}$.

Apart from generating the affinity matrix our pipeline also extracts the nearest neighboring trajectories for every trajectory.

The pairwise affinities for $n$ valid trajectories result in an $n \times n$ affinity matrix $W$.



%

 they define the edge weights of a graph with trajectories as vertices. trajectory pairs without overlap are assigned zero affinity. the emerging weighted graph is the basis for a grouping with spectral clustering. 
following such an approach, even trajectories that do not share frames can get transitively connected via other trajectories.

%
according to the gestalt principle of common fate
we should assign high affinities to pairs of points that move together.

two persons walking next to each other share the same motion although they are different objects.
a person sitting in a chair shares the same motion as the objects in the background. 
the gestalt principle tells us that these situations should be treated conservatively and objects should not be separated. 

in motion segmenation based on two frame optical flow objects cannot be separated in most frames as long as they do not show different motion permantly. 

at this point, the long-term aspect of trajectories is important. as we are not forced any longer to make decisions for each frame independently, we can pick for each pair of trajectories the time instant where the motion is maximally different.
according to the gestalt principle this instant provided evidence that the two points do not belong to the same object.


\section{Sparse Motion Segmentation}
There are three different segmentation methods available


Spectral clustering of the affinity matrix


\subsection{spectral clustering}
the eigenvectors of the normalized graph laplacian are used to generate segmentations that approximate the optimal normalized cut.
underlying assumption: objects in a scene have a certain size.

the min. cost multicut framework allows to formulate trajectory segmentations as an unbalanced grouping problem. this allows to retrieve very small but reasonable segments.

limitation: only well defined for non-negative affinity values between trajectories. in practise this means it is easy to specify which trajectories should be in the same segment but it is impossible to impose that they should be separated. 
\subsection{MinCut} 

\subsection{Kernighan-Lin} 
formulate trajectory motion segmentation as a minimum cost multicut problem on a trajectory graph. In this graph, positive and negative edge weights are computed from motion, position and color clues. positive and negative weights allow to optimize for the correct number of moving objects including small objects that show discriminative motion in a small number of frames. this approach is supposed to outperform spectral clustering as showin in $\cite{KB15b}$. \\ \\
Let $G = (E, V)$ be an undirected graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ the set of edges. The $KL$ algorithm attempts to find a partition of V into Two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of equal size, such that the sum $T$ of edge weights between the vertices in $A$ and $B$ is minimized. For defining the cost, let $I_a$ be the internal cost of the vertex $a$, which is defined as the sum of the costs of the edges between $a$ and other nodes in $A$. Furthermore, let $E_a$ denote the external cost of $a$, which is defined as the sum of the costs of edges between $a$ and the vertices in $B$. The balance of a vertex is given by the difference defined in equation $\ref{eq:kl_d_values}$.
\begin{equation}
	D_a = E_a - I_a
\label{eq:kl_d_values}
\end{equation}
If $a$ and $b$ are interchanged, then the reduction in cost is equals.
\begin{equation}
	T_{n} - T_{n-1} = D_a + D_b - 2c_{a,b}
\label{eq:kl_difference_ext_int_costs}
\end{equation}
Note that $c_{a,b}$ in equation $\ref{eq:kl_difference_ext_int_costs}$ defines the ost of the possible edge between $a$ and $b$. \\ \\
The $KL$ algorithms attempts to find an optimal series of interchange operations between the elements in $A$ and $B$, which maximizes the value of equation $\ref{eq:kl_difference_ext_int_costs}$. The determined optimal operation sequence is then executed to compute the partition of the graph into the sets $A$ and $B$. \\ \\

\section{Dense Motion Segmentation}
%TODO: use the dense segmentation as an input solve the problem of whole filling using a primal-dual convex algorithm. 


In this section I describe how I have actually Implemented the so far described dual-primal solver for demosaicing a raw image.

One important note in advance. In the discrete case, the following holds true 

\begin{align}
	\nabla^* (y^{n+1}) 
	&= \nabla^{T} (y^{n+1}) \nonumber \\
	&= div(y^{n+1})
\end{align}

So we have to omit a minus one factor. This affects the update rule for $x^{n+1}$ derived previously.

In the previous section we have defined explicit update rules. Aggregating all finding, mainly those from equation $\ref{eq:update_x_n_p_1}$ and $\ref{eq:update_rule_y_n_p_1}$, and plugging them into equation $\ref{eq:update_rules_plain}$ we get our update rules


\begin{align}
	y^{n+1} &= \frac{y^n + \sigma \nabla \bar{x}^{n}}{\max{\left(1,\twonorm{y^n + \sigma \nabla \bar{x}^{n}} \right)}} \nonumber \\
	x^{n+1} &= \frac{x^n - \tau div(y^{n+1}) +  \tau \lambda \Omega g}{1+\tau \lambda \Omega} \\
	\bar{x}^{n+1} &= x^{n+1} + \theta(x^{n+1} - x^n)
\label{eq:final_update_rules_plain}	
\end{align}

I initialized $x_n$ with the mosaiced image $g$, $y^{n}$ with a zeros \footnote{a tensor of dimension $M \times N \times 2$ filled with zeros, where $(M \times N)$ denotes the dimension of one color channel of $g$.} and $\bar{x}^{n}$ also with the mosaiced image $g$.

For computing $\nabla$ I used a forward difference approximation scheme. For computing the divergence operator of the vector-field $y^{n+1}$ I used backward difference approximation scheme. The reason for using a backward difference using a backward difference is to shift back gradients (remember, the divergence is applied to $y^{n+1}$ which is the result of a forward difference. Otherwise, when not altering between a forward-and backward difference we would end up with shifted gradients.

For computing the divergence, I relied on its mathematical definition. For a given vector-field $v = (v_x, v_y)$ the divergence is defined as the following:

\begin{align}
	div(v) = \partial_x v_x + \partial_y v_y
\end{align}

Since in our case we have $v = y^{n+1}$ and $y^{n+1}$ a vector valued function of the form $y^{n+1} = (y_{x}^{n+1}, (y_{y}^{n+1})$ it follows:

\begin{align}
	div(y^{n+1}) 
	&= div((y_{x}^{n+1}) + div((y_{y}^{n+1}) \\
	&= \left( \partial_x y_{x}^{n+1} + \partial_y y_{x}^{n+1} \right) + \left( \partial_x y_{y}^{n+1} + \partial_y y_{y}^{n+1} \right)
\end{align}

Initially, I used the following parameter setting:

\begin{align}
	\lambda &= 1000 \\
	\theta &= 0.5 \\
	\tau &= 2*10^{-3} \\
	\sigma &= \frac{1}{\tau * \sqrt{\norm{K}}}
\label{eq:parameter_set_up}	
\end{align}

With $\sqrt{\norm{K}} = \sqrt{4}$, a strong upper bound for the function $K$\footnote{A proof for the existence of this upper bound can be found in \cite{chambolle2004algorithm}}.

For consistency, a named all functions in my Matlab code the same as in this report. Furthermore I used a fixed number of iterations for computing my iterative demosaiced images.

the final algorithms I have to perform is the following:

For each color-channel $C \in \{R,G,B\}$ Do: Loop until $\norm{\bar{x}^{n+1} - \bar{x}^{n}}$ is small enough do: use parameter setup as defined in equation $\ref{eq:parameter_set_up}$ and then solve the update rules from equation $\ref{eq:final_update_rules_plain}$. Finally, merge all color iterative color channel solutions to a color image.

When computing the gradient and divergence finite approximation schemes, I used a zero padding boundary condition. Since I also tried out this kind of boundary condition in the first report, comparing the results produced in this project which those from the first project is valid.

One last comment: From the definition of the update rules, we see that the value of $\lambda$ directly affects the parameters $\tau$ and $\sigma$. Thus, when changing the value of $\lambda$ we also would have to find new best $\tau$ and $\sigma$ parameters. Hence, changing $\lambda$ also affects the convergence behaviour of the primal dual method. 

\section{Segment Merger}
In this section we describe our technique to reduce oversegmentations produced by our pipeline. This stage is invoked before running the evalaution program, implemented as a post-processing stage.

\caption[Segmentation Merger]{Visualization of our segment merger's input and output. As an input it expects a ground truth segmentation (see figure $\ref{fig:merger_result_a}$) and a generated oversegmentation (see figure $\ref{fig:merger_result_b}$). As output it yields the merged segmentation as shown in subfigure $\ref{fig:merger_result_c}$.}

Usually, the results generated by our pipeline exhibit an oversegmentation when comparing them against their ground truth. An example of such an oversegmentation is illustrated in figure $\ref{fig:merger_result_b}$. Ideally, before evaluating the quality, we would like to refine our over-segmented results in a way to reduce the total number of unnecessary segments. Therefore, we initially attempt to merge segments causing an oversegmentation of an ground truth mask. The goal of the merging phase is to lower the number of total segments but the same time retain meaningful segmentation labels. 

Conceptually, our merging approach is visualized in figure $\ref{fig:merger_result}$. Different approaches how to implement such a merging mechanism are described in literature (LIST SOME REFS HERE). However, we use a much simpler approach. 

A segmentation $S$ is basically a set of points in which every point is assigned to a certain segment identifier. In the following let us denote $S_j$ as the subset of points in $S$ that belong to the segmentation label $j$. Similarly, let $M$ denote the set of all ground truth points with their corresponding mask labels and $M_i$ the set of all points that belong to the ground truth mask $i$. To compute the merged segments we do the following: For every segment $S_j$ in $S$ we determine its best matching ground truth segment $M_i$ as defined in equation $\ref{eq:merging_label_formula}$. 
\begin{equation}
i = \argmaxl_{M_i \in M} \left\vert{S_j \cap M_i}\right\vert
\label{eq:merging_label_formula}
\end{equation}
The idea is to find the ground truth mask $i$ that yields the most point intersections with the currently considered segment $S_j$. Next, we update every point in $S_j$ by setting their segment label to $i$. After doing so we have computed the merged segmentation version of the initial oversegmentation. An example is shown in figure $\ref{fig:merger_result_c}$.
