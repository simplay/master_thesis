\end{itemize}

shortly summerize the contribution of this work
mention the limitations and limitations
mention passible future work

\section{Personal Experience}
parsing files was exhausting
working with foreign, sienctific code was not cool
one of best decisions: write unit tests
glue everything using a scripting language is superior
concurrency is your friend
cpp is evil
