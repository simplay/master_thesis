function [ img ] = mat2Img( A, B, C )
%MAT2IMG takes 3 (m x n) Matrices and reshapes them to an (m x n x 3) Image.
% @param A, B, and C are (m x n) matrices.
% Possible application: Conversion from R, G and B color channels to an image.
% @return (m x n x 3) img containing the matrix A,B,C in channel 1,2 or 3
% respectively.
% get dimensions [m, n]
[m, n] = size(A);
% reshape from 3(m x n) to (m x n x 3)
img = reshape([A,B,C], m, n, 3);
