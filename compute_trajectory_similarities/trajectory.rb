  # @info: a frame indices start counting at 1

  #   keep in mind: trajectories can start at an arbitrary frame
  #
  # @example: Explanation how index correction works.
  #   given 2 trajectories, A and B
  #   A: starts at frame 1 and goes till frame 4
  #   B: starts at frame 2 and goes till frame 5
  #   their overlapping frame are [2,3,4]
  #   therefore the lower index is 2
  #   and the upper index is 4
  #   assume we perform step sizes of 1, then
  #   we will iterate over the index set [2,3]
  #
  #   For A the first overlapping frame is its 2nd frame
  #   and for B it's its 1st frame. However,
  #   the index lookup is shifted for B, since it start
  #   in frame 2 whereas A starts at frame 1.
  #   subtracting the starting frame from the lookup index
  #   yields the correctt frame index.
  #   A: iter=2, iter-start = 2-1 = 1
  #     and index 1 correspnds to A's 2nd frame
  #   B: iter=2, iter-start = 2-2 = 0
  #     and index 0 corresponds to B's 1st frame
  #
  #   therfore the lookup index is given index-start_frame
